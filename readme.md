🏷️ Quality Info Record (QIR) Setup for a Vendor – SAP QM Project


1. Project Overview

            This project demonstrates the complete setup and usage of Quality Info Records (QIR) in SAP QM for controlling vendor quality during the procurement cycle.
            As an SAP QM Functional Consultant, this project highlights your understanding of Quality Management integration with Materials Management (MM) — without any coding.
      
            A QIR ensures that only approved vendors can supply materials and defines quality-related controls such as inspection type, release status, certificate requirements, and skip logic.


2. Business Scenario

      A manufacturing company wants to ensure that procurement is executed only through quality-approved vendors. A Quality Info Record is created to manage:
          
          Vendor approval for specific materials
          Inspection requirements at Goods Receipt
          Blocking procurement for unapproved vendors
          Managing validity and quality system certifications
